    <p>Making this lasagna recipe a day ahead and refrigerating overnight allows the spices to meld and gives it exceptional flavor.</p>

    <h1><strong>Directions:</strong></h1>

    <p>Gather all ingredients. Cook and stir ground beef, onion, and garlic in a large skillet over medium heat for 5 minutes; drain fat.</p>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Mix in diced tomatoes, tomato paste, brown sugar, basil, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and oregano. Simmer meat sauce, stirring occasionally, for 30 to 45 minutes. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain. Lay noodles flat on towels; blot dry. </li>
        <li>Layer 1/3 of the noodles in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover with 1/2 of the ricotta mixture. </li>
        <li>Cover the ricotta mixture with 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese, and 1/3 of the meat sauce. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving. </li>
    </ol>
